## Methodology

### Title Extraction (Pattern Matching)

**Script**: `scripts/extract_techniques_from_titles.R`

**Approach**:
- Defined 46 technique patterns with regex
- Matched against 63 presentation titles
- Mapped to 8 disciplines

**Coverage**: 49/63 presentations (77.8%)

### Abstract Extraction (Full-Text Search)

**Script**: `scripts/extract_techniques_from_abstracts.sh`

**Approach**:
- Extracted text from DOCX (unzip + XML parsing) and PDF (pdftotext)
- Searched for 56 technique patterns
- Captured context around each match

**Coverage**: 42/112 abstracts (37.5%)

### Technique Parsing

**Script**: `scripts/parse_techniques_from_abstracts.R`

**Approach**:
- Mapped patterns to clean technique names
- Assigned to 8 disciplines
- Extracted presentation IDs from filenames

### Tiered Classification

**Script**: `scripts/create_tiered_technique_classification.R`

**Approach**:
- Combined title and abstract data
- Applied parent-child hierarchy (manually defined)
- Created 46 parent-child pairs

## Output Files

### Primary Output
✅ **`outputs/analytical_techniques_by_discipline.csv`**
- Complete tiered classification
- Columns: discipline, tier, technique, technique_parent, n_total, n_from_titles, n_from_abstracts, sources

### Supporting Files
- `outputs/analytical_techniques_parents_only.csv` - Parent techniques only (quick reference)
- `outputs/techniques_from_titles.csv` - Full title extraction
- `outputs/techniques_from_titles_summary.csv` - Title summary by discipline
- `outputs/techniques_from_abstracts_structured.csv` - Structured abstract extraction
- `outputs/techniques_from_abstracts_summary.csv` - Abstract summary by discipline
- `outputs/abstracts_technique_counts.csv` - Technique counts per presentation

## Validation & Quality

### Strengths
✅ **Dual-source approach**: Combined broad patterns (titles) with detailed methods (abstracts)
✅ **Hierarchical structure**: Parent-child relationships capture method specificity
✅ **High title coverage**: 77.8% of presentations identified
✅ **Discipline-specific patterns**: Techniques mapped to appropriate disciplines

### Limitations
⚠️ **Abstract coverage**: Only 37.5% due to keyword-based approach
⚠️ **Manual hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships require domain expertise
⚠️ **Pattern-based**: May miss novel/uncommon techniques not in pattern list
⚠️ **Synonyms**: Different terms for same technique may be counted separately

### Quality Checks Performed
1. ✓ Cross-referenced title and abstract findings (13 techniques found in both)
2. ✓ Validated top techniques align with discipline expectations
3. ✓ Reviewed context snippets to confirm pattern matches
4. ✓ Checked for obvious false positives (none found)

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Expert Recruitment
Use technique list to search for specialists:
- "Acoustic telemetry" + "elasmobranch" → Movement experts
- "Stable isotope" + "shark diet" → Trophic ecologists

### 2. Gap Analysis
Identify underrepresented techniques:
- **Fisheries**: Limited technique diversity (only 2 techniques)
- **Trophic**: No fatty acid analysis in titles (found in abstracts)

### 3. Trend Analysis
Compare to historical conferences:
- Machine learning mentions increased
- Traditional morphometrics less common

### 4. Panel Discussion Topics
Highlight cutting-edge techniques:
- eDNA (emerging)
- Machine learning applications
- Citizen science methods

---

## Recommendations

### For Web Search (Phase 3)
Use top 3 techniques per discipline as search terms:
```
"acoustic telemetry" elasmobranch expert
"IUCN red list" shark ray assessment
"stable isotope" shark diet trophic
"machine learning" elasmobranch analysis
```

### For Database Enhancement
Add `analytical_techniques` column to candidate database with extracted values

### For Future Refinement
1. Review abstracts with 0 techniques identified (70 files)
2. Expand pattern list based on domain expert input
3. Consider NLP-based extraction for better abstract coverage
4. Add temporal component (technique trends over time)
