## Productive Discussion Questions


1. **Fisheries**: What stock assessment framework are you using? How are you handling data-poor scenarios?


2. **Conservation**: How are you integrating stakeholder input? What management recommendations emerge?


3. **Biology**: What validation methods are you using? How do your findings compare to congeners?


4. **Broader Context**: How does this work connect to other disciplines (e.g., conservation, fisheries management)?
