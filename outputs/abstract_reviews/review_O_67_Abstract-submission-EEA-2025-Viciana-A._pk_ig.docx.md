## Productive Discussion Questions


1. **Conservation**: How are you integrating stakeholder input? What management recommendations emerge?


2. **Behaviour**: How are you controlling for observer bias? What sample size did you achieve?


3. **Biology**: What validation methods are you using? How do your findings compare to congeners?


4. **Broader Context**: How does this work connect to other disciplines (e.g., conservation, fisheries management)?
