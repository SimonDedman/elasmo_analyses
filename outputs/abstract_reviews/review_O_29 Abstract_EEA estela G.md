## Abstract

```
Estela GrauAbstract This study describes the identiﬁcation of the ﬁrst multi-species shark nursery area in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Here, we evaluate various criteria through citizen science, satellite telemetry, and anecdotal evidence to characterize a shark nursery area for Caribbean Reef Sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) and Tiger Sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in St. Maarten waters. Results revealed that this area meets the following shark nursery criteria: size segregation, site ﬁdelity, skewed sex ratios, higher abundance of juvenile sharks, and presence of neonates, though not every criterion is met by both species. Additionally, satellite telemetry data showed empirical evidence of a pregnant tiger shark displaying site ﬁdelity in Saint Martin waters. Despite gaps in long-term residency patterns and the absence of baseline data, these ﬁndings underscore the ecological importance of St. Maarten waters for shark conservation. Future efforts should address legislative and conservati...
