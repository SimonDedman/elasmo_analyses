## Abstract

```
The deep-sea community of Suruga Bay, Japan: biodiversity and elasmobranch behavior using Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems
Ayumi Kuramae Izioka, Shannon Aldridge, Jeremy Jenrette, Yuuki Watanabe, Shigeto Motoki, Austin Gallagher
The deep sea, Earth's largest biome, is a critical component of global ecosystems, yet its biodiversity and ecological dynamics remain vastly understudied, particularly in regions with complex topography. Japan's Suruga Bay, a deep, tectonically active basin, is a recognized marine biodiversity hotspot with a long history of exploration, but a notable gap exists in quantitative visual survey data. This study provides a baseline assessment of the deep-sea demersal community structure and behavior in Suruga Bay using a standardized, non-extractive method. We conducted 10 deep-sea Baited Remote Underwater Video (dBRUV) deployments, sampling depths from 512 to 912 meters. A total of 171 unique taxa were recorded, including 27 species of elasmobranchs, confirm...

## Productive Discussion Questions


1. **Genetics**: What sequencing platform/depth are you using? Have you considered population structure effects?


2. **Conservation**: How are you integrating stakeholder input? What management recommendations emerge?


3. **Behaviour**: How are you controlling for observer bias? What sample size did you achieve?


4. **Broader Context**: How does this work connect to other disciplines (e.g., conservation, fisheries management)?
