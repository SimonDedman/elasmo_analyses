Human-wildlife interactions are crucial in shaping our understanding of nature and can significantly impact efforts to conserve endangered species and their habitats. As human activities continue to expand in the marine environment, encounters between humans and marine wildlife are expected to rise. Addressing and incorporating these interactions into conservation plans can provide valuable insights and bolster conservation efforts. In this study, we utilized the Marxan software to analyze data from the MECO citizen science project, focusing on two guitarfish ...
