Seamounts are biodiversity hotspots and recognized vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), yet their role 
in supporting migratory species is only beginning to be fully understood. Advances  in satellite tracking and 
underwater imaging reveal that seamounts are critical habitats for sharks and other elasmobranchs, 
serving as navigational landmarks, foragin...
