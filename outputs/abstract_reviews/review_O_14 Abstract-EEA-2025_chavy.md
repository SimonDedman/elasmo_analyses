Title
:
 
Mapping
 
Bycatch
 
Risk

Demersal

Abstract
:
 
Bycatch
 
from
 
bottom
 
trawl
 
fisheries
 
remains
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
pervasive
 
yet
 
understudied
 
threats
 
to
 
elasmobranchs
 
in
 
the
 
Northeast
 
Atlantic.
 
We
 
used
 
a
 
fishery-independent
 
approach
 
to
 
identify
 
high-risk
 
bycatch
 
zones
 
for
 
four
 
threatened
 
demersal
 
elasmobranch
 
tax
 
:
 
Amblyraja
 
radiata
,
 
Squalus
 
acanthias
,
 
Mustelus
 
spp.,
 
and
 
Dipturus
 
spp.
 
across
 
the
 
region.
 
Species
 
Distribution
 
Models
 
(SDMs)
 
were
 
developed
 
using
 
standardized
 
bottom
 
trawl
 
survey
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
FISHGLOB
 
database
 
(1993â€“2020)
 
combined
 
with
 
environmental
 
covariates
 
(depth,
 
temperature,
 
sediment,
 
and
 
distance
 
to
 
shore).
 
We
 
overlaid
 
model
 
predictions
 
with

## Productive Discussion Questions


1. **Fisheries**: What stock assessment framework are you using? How are you handling data-poor scenarios?


2. **Conservation**: How are you integrating stakeholder input? What management recommendations emerge?


3. **Broader Context**: How does this work connect to other disciplines (e.g., conservation, fisheries management)?
