Local Ecological Knowledge and Socio-economic Drivers of Migration of Artisanal Shark Fishers in West Africa

Abstract
The general perspective of migrant fishers targeting sharks, rays, and guitarfish, particularly regarding their movement patterns across local and international jurisdictions, remains unexplored. This study investigates guitarfish fisher's migration patterns both national and international, catch composition, and the drivers for the target of the species. The study used a mixed-method approach to gather both qualitative and quantitative information about the fisher's migration patterns. Guitarfish species were lumped together as “small” and “large” and many fishers (68%, n= 34) were unable to identify the sawfish. Fishers stated that they normally catch large-sized guitarfishes in Gambia, Benin, and Nigeria but relatively smaller individuals in Ghana and Ivory Coast. Many fishers perceived the reductions...
