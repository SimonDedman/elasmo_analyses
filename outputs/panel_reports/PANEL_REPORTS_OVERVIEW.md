## Key Discussion Questions for Panels

### For All Disciplines

#### 1. **Technique Completeness**
- Are there major techniques missing from the database?
- Should any techniques be combined or split?
- Are technique names clear and standardized?

#### 2. **Usage Patterns**
Looking at your discipline's stacked bar chart:
- Why might some techniques be less popular than expected?
- Are there underutilized techniques that should be promoted?
- Are highly popular techniques overused or appropriately dominant?

#### 3. **Emerging Techniques**
Review the emerging techniques list for your discipline:
- Which are most promising for the field?
- Which need more validation before widespread adoption?
- What are the pros & cons of each?
- What barriers exist to adoption?

#### 4. **Cross-Discipline Opportunities**
- What techniques from other disciplines could benefit your field?
- Which of your techniques could transfer to other areas?
- Are there collaboration opportunities?

### Discipline-Specific Prompts

#### **Behaviour (BEH)**
- Video analysis dominates - is this appropriate or limiting?
- How well have automated analysis tools (e.g., BORIS) been adopted?
- Should ethogram standardization be promoted?

#### **Biology (BIO)**
- Morphometric analysis vs. imaging techniques - complementary or competing?
- Are histological methods being displaced by molecular techniques?
- How important are aging/growth studies remaining?

#### **Conservation (CON)**
- Population modeling techniques - which are most reliable?
- IUCN assessment methods - standardized enough?
- How well integrated are socioeconomic methods?

#### **Data Science (DATA)**
- Machine learning penetration - which disciplines lag behind?
- Are traditional statistical methods still necessary?
- What new methods should be tracked (e.g., deep learning, AI)?

#### **Fisheries (FISH)**
- Catch data analysis - standardized or fragmented?
- Stock assessment methods - which should be prioritized?
- How well integrated are fishery-independent methods?

#### **Genetics (GEN)**
- NGS techniques - have they replaced traditional methods?
- Population genetics vs. genomics - both still needed?
- What emerging sequencing technologies should be tracked?

#### **Movement (MOV)**
- Acoustic vs. satellite telemetry - use cases for each?
- Are there gaps in movement analysis methods?
- How well adopted are advanced spatial models?

#### **Trophic Ecology (TRO)**
- Stable isotope analysis - limitations and alternatives?
- How well do molecular diet methods compare?
- Are trophic models standardized enough?

## Cross-Discipline Analysis Priority

### Data Science Penetration

**Key Questions**:
1. How well have modern data science methods (ML, AI, big data) penetrated each discipline?
2. Which disciplines lag behind and why?
3. What training/resources would accelerate adoption?
4. Are there concerns about "black box" methods in biological research?

### Common Techniques

Based on preliminary analysis, these techniques appear across multiple disciplines:
- Statistical modeling
- GIS/spatial analysis
- Database management
- Image analysis
- Time series analysis

**Discussion Points**:
- Should these be standardized across disciplines?
- Are they used similarly or differently?
- Opportunities for shared training?

### Technique Transfer

**Questions**:
- Which techniques could benefit from cross-pollination?
- Example: Could movement ecology methods help fisheries?
- Example: Could genetics inform conservation prioritization better?

## Panel Review Process

### Step 1: Individual Review
1. Review your discipline's stacked bar chart
2. Read through technique lists (emerging and established)
3. Note techniques that are:
   - Missing
   - Misnamed
   - Should be combined
   - Underutilized
   - Overemphasized

### Step 2: Cross-Discipline Review
1. Review DATA discipline chart
2. Identify data science methods relevant to your field
3. Note adoption levels and barriers

### Step 3: Group Discussion
1. Share individual findings
2. Discuss cross-discipline opportunities
3. Identify priority techniques for community attention
4. Suggest standardization needs

### Step 4: Recommendations
1. Techniques to add
2. Techniques to combine/remove
3. Emerging methods to promote
4. Training needs
5. Collaboration opportunities
