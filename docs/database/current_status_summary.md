## 🎯 Next Action: Run Full Download

Since test #3 was successful, you're ready to run the full download!

### Option A: Run Full Download Now (Background)

```bash
cd "/media/simon/data/Documents/Si Work/PostDoc Work/EEA/2025/Data Panel"

# Start background download
nohup ./venv/bin/python scripts/download_via_scihub_tor.py > logs/scihub_tor_full_download.log 2>&1 &

# Save process ID
echo $! > logs/scihub_tor_pid.txt

# Monitor progress
tail -f logs/scihub_tor_full_download.log
```

**Expected:**
- Duration: 10-20 hours
- New PDFs: +6,000-8,000
- Final total: ~11,000-13,000 PDFs
- Can run overnight

---

### Option B: Test with 10 Papers First

If you want extra confirmation before the full run:

```bash
cd "/media/simon/data/Documents/Si Work/PostDoc Work/EEA/2025/Data Panel"

./venv/bin/python scripts/download_via_scihub_tor.py --test-mode
```

This will test 10 random papers and show success rate.

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Once running, monitor with:

```bash
# Check how many processed
wc -l logs/scihub_tor_download_log.csv

# Check success rate
./venv/bin/python << 'EOF'
import pandas as pd
log = pd.read_csv("logs/scihub_tor_download_log.csv")
s = (log['status']=='success').sum()
print(f"Success: {s}/{len(log)} ({s/len(log)*100:.1f}%)")
EOF

# Count total PDFs
find "/media/simon/data/Documents/Si Work/Papers & Books/SharkPapers/" -name "*.pdf" | wc -l

# Monitor live
tail -f logs/scihub_tor_full_download.log
```

---

## 💾 Current Disk Usage

**SharkPapers directory:** Check current size:
```bash
du -sh "/media/simon/data/Documents/Si Work/Papers & Books/SharkPapers/"
```

**Expected after full download:**
- Current: ~10-15 GB (5,336 PDFs)
- After Tor download: ~25-40 GB (~11,000-13,000 PDFs)

Make sure you have at least 30-40 GB free space!

## 🔍 What Each Script Does

**Main downloader:** `scripts/download_via_scihub_tor.py`
- Routes through Tor network
- Only retries previously failed papers (efficient!)
- Saves to: `/media/simon/data/Documents/Si Work/Papers & Books/SharkPapers/YEAR/`
- Organizes by year automatically
- Logs to: `logs/scihub_tor_download_log.csv`

**File naming format:**
```
FirstAuthor.etal.YEAR.ShortTitle.pdf
```

Example:
```
Wilson.etal.2012.Age growth Myledaphus bipartitus late cretaceous freshwater.pdf
```

## 📋 Paper Status Breakdown

**From original Sci-Hub run (yesterday):**

- Failures: 10,249
  - Error: 6,183 (couldn't extract PDF)
  - Forbidden: 3,842 (IP blocked)

## 🚀 Recommended: Start Full Download

Since test was successful, recommended to start the full download:

```bash
cd "/media/simon/data/Documents/Si Work/PostDoc Work/EEA/2025/Data Panel"
nohup ./venv/bin/python scripts/download_via_scihub_tor.py > logs/scihub_tor_full_download.log 2>&1 &
