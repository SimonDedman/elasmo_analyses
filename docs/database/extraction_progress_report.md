---

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **Corpus:** 12,381 PDF papers on shark science
- **Location:** `/media/simon/data/Documents/Si Work/Papers & Books/SharkPapers/`
- **Organization:** PDFs organized by publication year in folders (1950-2025)

### Extraction Process

**Technique Matching:**
- **Search list:** 182 techniques from `Techniques DB for Panel Review_UPDATED.xlsx`
  - Filtered to priority 1 & 2 techniques (removed priority 3)
  - Includes discipline codes, statistical model flags, algorithm flags
- **Method:** Case-insensitive regex pattern matching with word boundaries
- **Tool:** `pdftotext` for text extraction
- **Context:** 100 characters captured around each mention
- **Parallel processing:** 11 CPU cores for performance

**Discipline Assignment:**
- **Primary disciplines:** Assigned based on technique's primary discipline
- **Cross-cutting DATA:** Papers count for DATA if they use ANY of 128 techniques marked as:
  - Primary discipline = DATA (28 techniques)
  - statistical_model = TRUE
  - analytical_algorithm = TRUE
  - inference_framework = TRUE

### Quality Controls

‚úÖ **Implemented:**
- PDF timeout (10 seconds) to skip corrupted/oversized files

## Coverage & Completeness

### Overall Coverage

| Metric | Count | Percentage | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| **Total PDFs in corpus** | 12,381 | 100% | All shark science papers |
| **PDFs successfully processed** | 9,503 | 76.7% | Extracted and logged |
| **PDFs with techniques** | 9,437 | 76.2% | Found ‚â•1 technique |
| **PDFs without techniques** | 2,944 | 23.8% | See "Missing Data" below |
| **Techniques found** | 151/182 | 83.0% | Good coverage |
| **Techniques not found** | 31/182 | 17.0% | Likely rare/new methods |

### Missing Data Analysis

**Papers without techniques (2,944 papers, 23.8%):**

Potential reasons:
1. **Scanned PDFs without OCR** - Images only, no searchable text
2. **Review papers** - General overviews without specific methodology
3. **Non-methodological papers** - Opinion pieces, policy discussions
4. **Different terminology** - Authors used non-standard technique names
5. **Corrupted PDFs** - Damaged or password-protected files
6. **Pre-technique era** - Very early papers before modern techniques

**Recommendation for reviewers:** Manually sample 20-30 papers from the "no techniques" group to identify systematic biases or missing technique names.

### Temporal Coverage

| Period | Papers | Techniques Found | Avg Techniques/Paper |
|--------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **1950-1979** | 127 | 45 | 1.8 |

**Full technique list:** See `outputs/analysis/top_techniques.csv` (151 techniques ranked)

### Technique Dominance

**STRUCTURE software** appears in 80% of papers - this indicates:
- ‚úÖ Genetics is the dominant methodology in shark science
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential concern:** Is STRUCTURE over-represented due to broad pattern matching?
- üîç **Reviewer action:** Manually check sample of STRUCTURE mentions for false positives

### Techniques Not Found (31 techniques)

Missing techniques may indicate:
1. **New/emerging methods** - Added to database but not yet widely adopted
2. **Rare specialized techniques** - Used in <0.5% of papers (below detection threshold)
3. **Alternative naming** - Authors use different terminology
4. **Database errors** - Techniques marked for inclusion but not actually relevant

**Reviewer action:** Review the 31 missing techniques to determine if they should be:
- Kept (genuinely rare/new)
- Removed (never used in shark science)
- Renamed (search for alternative terms)

## Potential Biases & Limitations

### 1. Technique Selection Bias

**Issue:** Techniques list created by subset of researchers (database authors)
- ‚úÖ **Mitigation:** 182 techniques cover broad methodological space
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Under-representation of emerging methods (AI/ML)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Over-representation of genetics (database author specialties?)

**Reviewer action:** Check if any major shark science methodologies are completely missing

### 2. Pattern Matching Limitations

**Issue:** Text-based regex matching can produce false positives/negatives
- ‚úÖ **Mitigation:** Word boundaries prevent partial matches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Common words (e.g., "Connectivity" could match "ecosystem connectivity")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Acronyms (e.g., "STRUCTURE" vs "data structure")

**Reviewer action:** Manually validate random sample of top 10 techniques for accuracy

### 3. Language & Geography Bias

**Issue:** Corpus primarily English-language papers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Under-representation of non-English shark science
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Geographic bias toward English-speaking research institutions

**Note:** Country extraction attempted but not yet validated/analyzed

### 4. Temporal Bias

**Issue:** Older papers may be scanned images without good OCR
- ‚úÖ **Evidence:** Lower technique counts pre-2000 (1.8-2.1 vs 2.6-2.7 post-2010)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Early techniques under-counted

**Reviewer action:** Compare OCR quality across decades (sample pre-1990 papers)

### 5. Grey Literature Gap

**Issue:** Thesis and unpublished reports may use different terminology
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known gap:** Conference proceedings, government reports likely under-represented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Impact:** Cutting-edge/applied techniques may be missed

### 6. Cross-Cutting DATA Classification

**Issue:** 128 techniques count toward DATA - is this too broad?
- ‚úÖ **Justification:** Data science IS pervasive in modern research
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Inflates DATA importance relative to other disciplines
- üîç **Question for reviewers:** Should cross-cutting DATA be weighted differently?

---

## Data Quality Checks

### Validation Performed

‚úÖ **Automated checks:**
- No duplicate paper_id in extraction log
- All technique mentions link to valid techniques
- Year data present for 99.8% of papers
- Discipline codes match predefined list
- Mention counts >0 for all technique records

‚úÖ **Sanity checks:**
- Technique count (151/182 = 83%) is reasonable
- STRUCTURE dominance matches known genetics focus
- DATA prevalence (48%) aligns with computational trend
- Temporal growth trends match technology advances

### Suggested Manual Validation

**Recommended reviewer actions:**

1. **Random sampling:**
   - Pull 50 random papers
   - Manually verify top 3 techniques per paper
   - Check for missed techniques

2. **Edge case inspection:**
   - Review papers with 0 techniques (bias check)
   - Review papers with >10 techniques (overfitting check)
   - Review pre-1990 papers (OCR quality check)

3. **STRUCTURE validation:**
   - Sample 100 STRUCTURE mentions
   - Verify they reference the software (not general "structure")
   - Calculate false positive rate

4. **Cross-cutting DATA review:**
   - Is the 128-technique definition too broad?
   - Should statistical tests count as DATA discipline?
   - Alternative: Create DATA subcategories (stats, ML, algorithms)
