## Acquisition Methods Tested

### ‚úÖ Method 1: Direct Download (PRIMARY SUCCESS)
**Status:** Successful
**PDFs Acquired:** 616 valid PDFs
**Success Rate:** 45.1% of attempts yielded valid PDFs

**Approach:**
- Direct HTTP requests to PDF URLs from shark-references.com database
- Used 30-second timeout, polite rate limiting (1.5s delays)
- Validated PDFs by checking `%PDF-` header

**Results:**
- 2,653 "success" entries in log (but many were HTML not PDF)
- 616 valid PDFs actually saved to disk
- Organized by year in `outputs/SharkPapers/YEAR/` folders
- Proper filename format: `FirstAuthor.etal.YEAR.Title.pdf`

**Key Finding:** Many "successful" downloads actually received HTML paywall pages instead of PDFs, resulting in lower than expected valid PDF count.

---

### ‚úÖ Method 2: Dropbox Library Integration (MODERATE SUCCESS)
**Status:** Successful
**PDFs Acquired:** 97 papers (from 2,727 Dropbox PDFs)
**Match Rate:** 15.5% (423 matched, 97 were new additions)

**Approach:**
1. Scanned all PDFs in `~/Dropbox/Galway/Papers/` using `pdfinfo`
2. Extracted title metadata from each PDF
3. Matched against database using lowercase title comparison
4. Copied matched PDFs to proper folder structure

**Results:**
- 423 Dropbox PDFs matched database papers
- 97 were new (not previously downloaded)
- 326 were duplicates (already had from direct downloads)
- Added to download log with status `dropbox_success`

**Script:** Created inline Python script for scanning and matching

---

### ‚úÖ Method 3: Manual Downloads + Metadata Extraction (PARTIAL SUCCESS)
**Status:** Partially successful
**PDFs Acquired:** 44 properly matched, 148 need manual organization

**Approach:**
1. User manually downloaded PDFs from institutional access (NCBI, PeerJ, SciELO)
2. Scripts extracted PDF metadata using `pdfinfo`
3. Matched titles against database
4. Auto-organized matched PDFs, manual review for unmatched

**Results by Source:**
- **NCBI (73 PDFs):** 11 matched properly, 62 ‚Üí unknown_year
- **PeerJ (81 PDFs):** 33 matched properly, 48 ‚Üí unknown_year
- **SciELO (38 PDFs):** 0 matched (poor metadata), 38 ‚Üí unknown_year

**Total:** 44 matched + 148 pending manual organization

**Challenge:** Many PDFs have poor or missing title metadata, requiring manual filename-based matching.

---

### ‚ùå Method 4: Open Access API Retrieval (FAILED)
**Status:** Failed - 0% success rate
**PDFs Acquired:** 0
**Test Sample:** 50 papers

**APIs Tested:**
1. **Unpaywall API** - Searches institutional repositories, PubMed Central, arXiv
2. **Semantic Scholar API** - Academic search with PDF links
3. **CrossRef API** - Publisher metadata and OA links
4. **DOI Resolution** - Direct DOI‚ÜíPDF resolution

**Results:**
- Test run on 50 papers: 0 successes (0.0%)
- All 50 papers returned "not_found" status
- Average processing time: 6.6 seconds per paper

**Why It Failed:**
1. Most papers are behind paywalls (ScienceDirect, Wiley, Taylor & Francis)
2. Recent papers (2024-2025) not yet deposited in open repositories
3. Shark biology journals don't have strong open access policies
4. Valid DOIs but papers simply aren't available as open access

**Recommendation:** **Do not run full retrieval on remaining 3,034 papers** - would take ~5.5 hours with 0% expected success rate.

**Script Created:** `scripts/retrieve_papers_multisource.py` (functional but ineffective for this dataset)

---

### ‚ùå Method 5: Extended Timeout Retry (FAILED)
**Status:** Failed
**Papers Attempted:** 104 papers that timed out at 30s
**Retry Timeout:** 60s
**Success Rate:** 0% (2 papers tested, both still timed out)

**Approach:** Retry papers that timed out during initial download with longer 60s timeout

**Results:**
- Process too slow (~3 minutes per paper)
- Papers still timing out even with 60s timeout
- Likely extremely large files or very slow servers
- **Recommendation:** Stop retry, not worth the time

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Priority 1: Maximize Existing Resources ‚≠ê

1. **Organize the 148 pending PDFs in `unknown_year/`**
   - These are already downloaded, just need proper organization
   - Manual matching by filename to database
   - Potential to add 148 more papers to collection

2. **Wait for NOAA Government Shutdown to End**
   - Retry 130 NOAA papers when sites come back online
   - These are government open access papers (easy to download)
   - High success rate expected

### Priority 2: Manual Institutional Access Downloads ‚ö†Ô∏è

3. **Continue manual downloads through institutional access**
   - Focus on high-value domains: Wiley (337), Taylor & Francis (136)
   - Use Firefox cache extraction workflow
   - Spread over time to avoid rate limiting
   - **Estimated time:** 2-4 hours for ~500 papers

### Priority 3: Alternative Sources üìö

4. **Papers without URLs (24,635 papers)**
   - Try searching by DOI or title on:
     - Google Scholar
     - ResearchGate
     - Academia.edu
     - Author university pages
   - Contact authors directly for PDFs
   - Use Inter-Library Loan (ILL) for critical papers

### Priority 4: Report Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

5. **Report to shark-references.com:**
   - revbiolmar.cl hijacked (39 papers)
   - www.labomar.ufc.br broken (31 papers)
   - Request alternative URLs if available

### Not Recommended ‚ùå

- **Do NOT run full multi-source API retrieval** (0% success rate on test)
- **Do NOT continue timeout retry** (too slow, 0% success rate)
- **Do NOT attempt ScienceDirect automated downloads** (CAPTCHA blocks)

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: HTML Instead of PDF
**Problem:** Many "successful" downloads received HTML paywall pages instead of PDFs
**Impact:** Log shows 2,653 successes but only 616 valid PDFs saved
**Solution:** Implemented PDF header validation (`%PDF-` check)

### Challenge 2: Poor PDF Metadata
**Problem:** Many PDFs have missing or generic titles (e.g., "document1.pdf", "v32n3a01.pmd")
**Impact:** Automatic title-based matching fails
**Solution:** Manual organization required for ~148 PDFs

### Challenge 3: Rate Limiting
**Problem:** Publishers block after too many rapid requests
**Impact:** ScienceDirect CAPTCHA blocks, temporary IP bans
**Solution:** Implemented polite delays (1.5s), spread downloads over time

### Challenge 4: Broken Domain Infrastructure
**Problem:** Multiple domains hijacked, down, or broken
**Impact:** 244 papers completely inaccessible (revbiolmar.cl, labomar.ufc.br, etc.)
**Solution:** Document issues, report to shark-references.com, seek alternatives

### Challenge 5: Open Access Availability
**Problem:** Most papers not available in open repositories
**Impact:** 0% success rate with Unpaywall, Semantic Scholar, CrossRef APIs
**Reason:** Recent papers (2024-2025), specialized journals, strong paywalls
**Solution:** Focus on institutional access and manual acquisition

---

## Success Metrics

### What Worked Well ‚úÖ
1. **Direct downloads:** 616 valid PDFs acquired automatically
2. **Dropbox integration:** 97 additional PDFs found and organized
3. **Manual downloads:** 44 PDFs properly matched and organized
4. **Documentation:** Comprehensive tracking of all attempts and issues

### What Didn't Work ‚ùå
1. **Open access APIs:** 0% success rate (Unpaywall, Semantic Scholar, CrossRef)
2. **Extended timeout retry:** Still timing out at 60s
3. **Automated paywall bypass:** Publishers too sophisticated
4. **Broken domain recovery:** Hijacked/dead sites not recoverable

### Overall Assessment
- **Automated approach:** Moderately successful (10.5% of attempts yielded valid PDFs)
- **Hybrid approach needed:** Combination of automated + manual + institutional access
- **Realistic expectation:** Acquiring 50%+ of 30,523 papers will require significant manual effort and institutional access

## Conclusion

The automated PDF acquisition phase has completed with **616 valid PDFs** acquired (2.0% of database). While this represents a modest portion of the database, it provides a solid foundation of recent, open-access papers.

**Key Findings:**
1. Direct automated downloads work but have ~10% success rate due to paywalls
2. Open access APIs ineffective for recent, specialized shark biology papers (0% success)
3. Institutional access required for majority of papers (thousands paywalled)
4. Manual effort needed to achieve higher coverage (>50% of database)

**Moving Forward:**
- **Short term:** Organize 148 pending PDFs, retry NOAA papers after shutdown
- **Medium term:** Manual downloads through institutional access (~500 high-priority papers)
- **Long term:** Systematic DOI/title search for papers without URLs (24,635 papers)

**Estimated Total Effort to Reach 50% Coverage (~15,000 PDFs):**
- Automated methods: ‚úÖ Complete (616 PDFs)
- Manual institutional downloads: 2-4 weeks part-time (~2,000-3,000 PDFs)
- DOI/title searches: 3-6 months part-time (~10,000-12,000 PDFs)
- **Total: 4-7 months of sustained effort**
