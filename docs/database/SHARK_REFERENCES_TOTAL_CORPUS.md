## Recent Years (2015-2025)

| Year | Papers | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **2025** | 192 | Partial year (as of November 2025) |
| **2024** | 290 | Recent publications still being indexed |
| **2023** | 294 | |
| **2022** | 456 | |
| **2021** | 579 | |
| **2020** | 618 | **PEAK YEAR** 🏆 |

| **2017** | 547 | |
| **2016** | 557 | |
| **2015** | 535 | |

**Observation**: Peak production in 2020, followed by decline in 2021-2025. This may reflect:
1. Pandemic impact on research activities
2. Lag time in database indexing (2024-2025 papers still being added)
3. Natural plateau after exponential growth phase

## Context: Parachute Research Trends

From temporal analysis of parachute research (Phase 4 results):

| Decade | Parachute Research Rate | Trend |
|--------|------------------------|-------|
| **1990-1999** | 48.9% | Baseline |
| **2000-2009** | 46.6% | Slight decline |
| **2010-2019** | 51.6% | **Increase** |
| **2020-2024** | 53.9% | **Highest rate** |
| **2024 only** | 61.0% | **Peak parachute year** |

**Key Finding**: As total publications increased by 135% in the 2010s, parachute research (Global North → Global South) also increased from 46.6% to 51.6%, and continues rising in 2020-2024 (53.9%). This suggests that field expansion has NOT been accompanied by proportional growth in local research capacity in the Global South.

## Implications for Abstract

### For EEA 2025 Abstract (November 30 deadline):

**Corpus Size Statement**:
> "This analysis encompasses 12,207 shark research publications from 1950-2025 indexed in the shark-references database. The corpus shows exponential growth, with 80% of all papers published since 1990 and 60% since 2010, reflecting increased global interest in shark conservation and research."

**Growth Context for Parachute Research**:
> "Despite a 135% increase in shark research publications in the 2010s (4,926 papers, compared to 2,094 in the 2000s), parachute research patterns have increased rather than decreased. In the 2020-2024 period, 53.9% of field studies show parachute research patterns (author country ≠ study country), up from 46.6% in the 2000s. This suggests that research expansion has primarily benefited Global North institutions, with limited growth in local research capacity in biodiversity hotspots."

## Technical Notes

### Data Extraction Method

**Year extraction**: Years were extracted from paper_id field using regex pattern `\.(\d{4})\.` (format: `Author.etal.YYYY.Title.pdf`)

**Success rate**: 99.7% (12,207/12,240 papers)

**Missing years**: 33 papers (0.3%) either:
- Lack year in filename
- Have malformed filenames
- Have years outside 1950-2025 range

### Database Source

**Table**: `extraction_log` in `database/technique_taxonomy.db`

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT paper_id FROM extraction_log;
-- Returns: 12,240 papers
```

**Year extraction**:
```python
year_match = re.search(r'\.(\d{4})\.', paper_id)
if year_match:
    year = int(year_match.group(1))
```

| **Phase 1-3: Author countries** | 6,183 | 50.7% |
| **Phase 4: Study locations** | 4,003 | 32.8% |
| **Phase 4: Parachute research** | 2,022 | 16.6% |

**Interpretation**:
- **50.7%** of shark research papers have extractable author country data
- **32.8%** have extractable study location data from Methods sections
- **16.6%** show parachute research patterns (Global North authors, Global South field sites)
