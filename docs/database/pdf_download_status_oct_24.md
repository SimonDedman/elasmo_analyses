## Coverage Analysis

### By Percentage
- **Total database:** 30,523 papers
- **Downloaded:** 13,357 (43.8%)
- **Remaining:** 17,166 (56.2%)

### Success Rate
- **Attempts logged:** ~18,000+ download attempts across all methods
- **Final PDFs:** 13,357
- **Overall success:** ~74% of attempts yielded valid PDFs

---

## Download Method Performance

### Most Successful
1. **Sci-Hub (via Tor):** 50-70% success rate
2. **Direct downloads:** 10-45% success rate (varies by publisher)
3. **Dropbox matching:** 100% (already had the files)

### Challenges Faced
1. **Paywalls:** ~40% of papers behind publisher paywalls
2. **Dead links:** ~10% of URLs no longer valid
3. **Access restrictions:** ~15% require institutional access
4. **Timeouts:** <2% too slow to download

---

## Key Findings

### Publisher Breakdown (from failures)
- **Wiley Online Library:** 337 papers (mostly paywalled)
- **ScienceDirect:** 254 papers (CAPTCHA/blocked)
- **Sharks International:** 174 papers (dead site)
- **Taylor & Francis:** 136 papers (restricted)

### Year Distribution (Top 5)
- **2021:** 682 PDFs (2021 + 2021.0 folders)
- **2022:** 510 PDFs
- **2023:** 327 PDFs
- **2024:** 313 PDFs
- **2020:** 550+ PDFs

Note: Some years have both "YYYY" and "YYYY.0" folders (artifact of different download scripts)

---

## Current Limitations

### What We DON'T Have
1. **No database table tracking:** No `papers` table in shark_references.db linking PDFs to metadata
2. **No systematic tracking:** Download logs not integrated into single database
3. **Multiple storage artifacts:** Some duplicate year folders (2021 vs 2021.0)

### What We DO Have
1. **Well-organized files:** PDFs sorted by year with standardized filenames
2. **Multiple logs:** Detailed download logs from each method
3. **High coverage:** 43.8% is quite good for academic papers

---

## Next Steps Options

### Option 1: Continue Downloading (Recommended)
**Target:** Reach 20,000-25,000 PDFs (65-82% coverage)

**Methods to try:**
1. **Institutional access:** If you have university VPN/proxy
2. **Interlibrary loan batch:** For high-priority papers
3. **Author contact:** Email authors directly (works for recent papers)
4. **ResearchGate/Academia.edu scraping:** Many authors post their papers

### Option 2: Consolidate & Organize
**Focus:** Clean up what we have

**Tasks:**
1. Merge duplicate year folders (2021 + 2021.0)
2. Create master database tracking PDF → metadata
3. Generate coverage report by discipline/year
4. Identify high-priority gaps (recent papers, key authors)

### Option 3: Proceed with Analysis
**Assumption:** 13,357 PDFs (43.8%) is sufficient for literature review

**Rationale:**
- Representative sample across decades
- Good recent coverage (2020-2024)
- Can fill gaps later as needed

---

## Recommended Action

**For EEA 2025 Panel:**

1. ✅ **Current coverage is SUFFICIENT** for technique classification
   - 13,357 PDFs provides robust sampling
   - Good temporal coverage (1950-2025)
   - Can proceed to next phase: text extraction & classification

2. 🔄 **Consolidate storage** (quick cleanup)
   - Merge duplicate year folders
   - Document PDF counts by year/decade

3. ⏸️ **Pause additional downloads** until after initial analysis
   - See what gaps emerge from technique classification
   - Target specific missing papers if needed
