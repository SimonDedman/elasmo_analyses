## Background & Context

### Rationale

Elasmobranch research has experienced rapid methodological evolution across multiple disciplines. From traditional life history studies to cutting-edge genomics, spatial modeling, and citizen science initiatives, the field continues to expand and diversify. However, several challenges have emerged:

1. **Information Fragmentation:** Practitioners struggle to stay current across multiple analytical domains
2. **Method Accessibility Gap:** Uncertainty about which new techniques are robust vs. experimental
3. **Resource Identification:** Difficulty locating code, protocols, and best practices
4. **Cross-Disciplinary Awareness:** Limited understanding of analytical approaches outside one's specialty
5. **Temporal Knowledge Decay:** Systematic reviews become outdated within 3-5 years (Whitlock et al., 2008)

### Panel Philosophy

This panel aims to bridge these gaps by:

- Providing **expert-curated overviews** of current analytical techniques across elasmobranch science disciplines
- Offering **pragmatic guidance** distinguishing proven methods from emerging approaches
- Creating a **living resource** that can be updated annually at major conferences
- Building **community connections** by identifying and connecting practitioners in each subdiscipline
- Establishing **infrastructure** for long-term knowledge curation through collaboration with Shark-References database

### Conference Context

**Observed Trends at Recent EEAs (per Irene Kingma):**
- Declining: Traditional isotope and genetics studies
- Increasing: Food/stomach content analysis, spatial analysis, fisheries interactions, tracking studies
- Need: Climate change integration, data accessibility solutions, focus on less charismatic species

**Comparative Context:**
- EEA vs. AES differences in regional focus and collaboration patterns
- Growing international collaboration opportunities
- Increasing representation from ICES vs. NOAA institutions in European conferences

## Panel Aims & Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Review:** Systematically document current analytical techniques across major elasmobranch research disciplines
2. **Expert Evaluation:** Assess strengths, weaknesses, and suitability of different approaches through specialist insight
3. **Temporal Mapping:** Identify historical trends, current "hot" methods, declining approaches, and emerging frontiers
4. **Knowledge Transfer:** Create accessible overviews valuable to both practitioners and non-specialists
5. **Network Building:** Connect researchers within and across disciplines
6. **Resource Creation:** Develop an updateable, shareable reference document with literature links

### Secondary Objectives

1. **Database Integration:** Establish methodology for automated trend analysis using Shark-References
2. **Annual Updates:** Create sustainable model for yearly updates at EEA and AES conferences
3. **Living Database Development:** Explore infrastructure for ongoing curation (Sharkipedia integration, dedicated platform, etc.)
4. **Student Engagement:** Leverage PhD literature reviews to seed and maintain databases
5. **Methodological Innovation:** Develop reproducible workflow for discipline-specific systematic reviews

### Evaluation Criteria for Analytical Techniques

Each method will be assessed on:

- **Accuracy:** Reliability and precision of results
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Resource requirements (financial, temporal, computational)
- **Accessibility:** Required expertise, training barriers, code/protocol availability
- **Scalability:** Application across different study systems and scales
- **Maturity:** Proven vs. experimental status
- **Trend trajectory:** Growing, stable, or declining adoption

## Systematic Review Methodology

### Review Classification

Following Grant and Booth (2009), our approach is a **mixed-method umbrella/scoping/state-of-the-art review**, combining:

**Umbrella Review Component:**
- Compiling existing systematic reviews across disciplines
- Synthesizing meta-analytical findings where available

**Scoping Review Component:**
- Mapping extent and nature of analytical literature
- Identifying knowledge gaps requiring supplementary primary research

**State-of-the-Art Component:**
- Emphasizing current and emerging techniques
- Expert perspective on future trajectories

**Justification:** Full systematic reviews are impractical given timeline; meta-analyses unnecessary for technique cataloguing. We follow **PRISMA-SCR guidelines** (Tricco et al., 2018), which permit single-source use and methodological flexibility.

## Integration with Shark-References Database

### Current Capabilities (per Jürgen Pollerspöck correspondence)

**Shark-References Database Features:**
- **Fulltext Search:** Searches complete paper text (not just titles/abstracts)
- **CSV Export:** Download search results with: authors, year, title, journal, DOI, abstract, download links
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Extensive elasmobranch literature database
- **Active Maintenance:** Curated by Jürgen Pollerspöck & Nico Straube

**Limitations:**
- "Place" keyword currently exclusive to fossil papers (could be expanded)
- Pagination display bug noted (cosmetic issue)
- Not all papers have download links (depends on open access)

### Proposed Workflow for Trend Analysis

**Step 1: Define Search Terms**
- Per analytical technique identified in systematic review
- May require multiple synonymous terms per technique
- Example: "boosted regression tree" OR "BRT" OR "gradient boosting"

**Step 2: Execute Searches**
- Use "Search term (Only Fulltext)" on Shark-References
- Download CSV for each search
- Save with descriptive filename (e.g., "BRT_search_2025-10-15.csv")

**Step 3: Data Processing**
```r
# Pseudocode structure
library(tidyverse)

# Read all CSVs in loop
search_files <- list.files(pattern = "*.csv")
all_results <- map_dfr(search_files,
                       ~read_csv(.x) %>%
                        mutate(search_term = str_remove(.x, ".csv")))

# De-duplicate within technique clusters
# (papers may appear in multiple related searches)
deduped <- all_results %>%
  group_by(technique_cluster) %>%
  distinct(doi, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Temporal trends
trends <- deduped %>%
  count(search_term, year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = search_term)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Step 4: Visualization**
- Publications per technique per year
- Proportional adoption (technique / total discipline papers)
- Regional breakdowns (if location data available)
- Taxonomic focus (if species data extracted)

### Potential Long-Term Integration

**Automated Annual Updates:**
- Backend scheduled queries to Shark-References
- Automated CSV download and processing
- Dashboard auto-refresh with new data
- Flagging of newly emerging techniques (sudden publication increases)

**Two-Way Data Flow:**
- Our curated technique taxonomy feeds back to Shark-Ref as enhanced keywords
- Enables more sophisticated filtering for users
- Potential for "analytical methods" tag system

**Infrastructure Questions (to discuss with Jürgen/Nico post-conference):**
- API access to Shark-References?
- Database format and query capabilities?
- Interest in hosting analytical methods dashboard?
- Funding/staffing model for maintenance?
- Parallel with Sharkipedia, FishBase models?

## Discipline-Specific Review Structure

### Refined 8-Discipline Framework

Following comprehensive analysis of Carrier et al. (2019), AES 2024 conference patterns, EEA trends, and published taxonomies (see `Discipline_Structure_Analysis.md`), the panel has been restructured from 6 to **8 refined disciplines**:

**Previous 6 Disciplines (Presenter-Focused):**
1. Biology/Ecology
2. Genetics/Genomics
3. Spatial (SDM & MPA)
4. Fisheries
5. Policy/Conservation
6. Statistics (General Methods)

**Refined 8 Disciplines (Analytical-Methods-Focused):**
1. **Biology, Life History, & Health** (expanded to include disease, parasites, telomere aging)
2. **Behaviour & Sensory Ecology** (NEW - separated from Ecology; substantial AES presence)
3. **Trophic & Community Ecology** (NEW - separated from general Ecology; distinct methods)
4. **Genetics, Genomics, & eDNA** (retained, eDNA explicitly included)
5. **Movement, Space Use, & Habitat Modeling** (expanded from "Spatial" to emphasize movement ecology)
6. **Fisheries, Stock Assessment, & Management** (retained)
7. **Conservation Policy & Human Dimensions** (expanded to include citizen/social science)
8. **Data Science & Integrative Methods** (expanded to include data integration, AI/ML)

**Key Changes:**
- **Ecology split** into Behaviour, Trophic, and integrated into Biology → Better reflects distinct analytical toolkits
- **Behaviour elevated** to standalone discipline → Dedicated AES sessions, Carrier section, unique methods
- **Trophic Ecology** separated → Isotopes, eDNA for diet, stomach contents are distinct subdiscipline
- **Health added** to Biology → Telomere studies, disease, parasites emerging at conferences
- **Movement** added to Spatial → Movement ecology dominates conferences; telemetry ≠ SDMs
- **Human Dimensions** added to Policy → Social science, citizen science, tourism have unique methods
- **Data Integration** emphasized in Data Science → AES 2024 symposium; emerging critical field

**Climate Change Integration:**
- **NOT a standalone discipline** but cross-cutting theme
- Each discipline addresses climate-relevant methods (see Discipline_Structure_Analysis.md)

### Recommended: Option A (Panel First, Then Presentations)

**Rationale:**
1. **Context Setting:** Panel reviews provide methodological framework before detailed presentations
2. **Flexibility:** If some panel experts unavailable, time redistributes easily
3. **Clean Separation:** Distinct panel component vs. traditional talks
4. **Audience Priming:** Audience understands analytical landscape before deep-dives

### 8 Refined Disciplines for Panel Reviews

Based on comprehensive discipline analysis (see Discipline_Structure_Analysis.md):

1. **Biology, Life History, & Health** (5 min if expert available)
2. **Behaviour & Sensory Ecology** (5 min if expert available)
3. **Trophic & Community Ecology** (5 min if expert available)
4. **Genetics, Genomics, & eDNA** (5 min if expert available)
5. **Movement, Space Use, & Habitat Modeling** (5 min if expert available)
6. **Fisheries, Stock Assessment, & Management** (5 min if expert available)
7. **Conservation Policy & Human Dimensions** (5 min if expert available)
8. **Data Science & Integrative Methods** (5 min if expert available)

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **If all 8 experts available:** 5 min each (40 min) + 5 min intro/synthesis = 45 min
- **If only 5-6 experts available:** 6-7 min each + extended discussion = 45 min
- **If fewer experts:** Allocate time to open forum discussion, audience Q&A

### Confirmed Oral Presentation Speakers (FIXED - 10 min each)

**From current planning (to be confirmed with Irene):**
1. **Amy Jeffries** - *"Physiological Limits and Behavioural Trade-Offs: How Blue shark (Prionace glauca) Adapt to Oxygen-Depleted Waters"*
2. **Charlotte Nuyt** - *"Optimising environmental DNA techniques for monitoring bycatch of endangered shark and ray species in the Northeast Atlantic"*
3. **Edward Lavender** - *"Statistical tools for tracking elasmobranchs and advancing conservation"*
4. **Nicholas Dulvy** - *"Sharks, rays, and chimaeras reveal a more just and equitable view of global fisheries"*
5. **Maria Dolores Riesgo** - *"Trust your model: unbalanced data from rare species does not imply unreliable predictions"*

**NOTE:** Confirm final speaker list and topics with Irene. Presentation order can be optimized to align with panel review sequence if using Option B.

### Interaction Strategies

**During Discipline Presentations:**
- Highlight (co)authors present in audience for featured papers
- Encourage brief clarifying questions (defer longer discussions to open forum)

**Open Forum Facilitation:**
- Ask practitioners in each subdiscipline to stand/raise hands for visibility
- Structured questions to panel (prepared) interspersed with audience questions
- Capture suggestions for techniques/approaches missed

**Post-Session:**
- Collect business cards / contact info from interested contributors
- Note suggestions for resource improvement
- Recruit volunteers for annual update process

Subject: Invitation to Contribute - EEA 2025 Data Panel on [DISCIPLINE]

Dear [Name],

We are writing to invite you to contribute to an innovative panel session at the European Elasmobranch Association Conference in Rotterdam (30 October 2025).

Simon Dedman, Guuske Tiktak, and I are organizing "New Frontiers in Elasmobranch Data Analysis," which will provide a comprehensive overview of current and emerging analytical techniques across our field. We are conducting systematic reviews of major disciplines and would greatly value your expertise in [DISCIPLINE].

Your role would involve:
- Reviewing existing systematic reviews in [discipline] (we'll help identify these)
- Identifying and documenting current analytical techniques
- Providing expert assessment of method strengths, limitations, and trends
- Creating a visual mind map of technique relationships
- Participating in a 6-minute presentation during the panel (optional)

We estimate this will require approximately [X hours] over the next [Y weeks]. We have developed streamlined templates and methodology (attached) to make this as efficient as possible, and a trial review demonstrates it is feasible within this timeframe.

This initiative aims to create a living database that will be updated annually at EEA and AES conferences. All contributors will be acknowledged, and we plan to publish the methodology and database as a citable resource.

Would you be interested in participating? We would also appreciate the phonetic pronunciation of your name for proper introductions.

Please let us know by [DATE]. Attached you will find:
- Detailed methodology document
- Template spreadsheet with example
- Timeline and expectations

We're excited about the potential for this project to serve the elasmobranch research community, and your contribution would be invaluable.

Best regards,
Simon Dedman & Guuske Tiktak

**Template 2: Shark-References Collaboration Inquiry**

Subject: Potential Collaboration - Analytical Technique Trend Analysis

Dear Jürgen and Nico,

Thank you for your previous correspondence about Shark-References' fulltext search capabilities. We are further developing our "trends in shark science methods" project for the EEA 2025 conference panel and believe there may be exciting collaboration opportunities.

Our Proposed Workflow:
1. Systematic review identifies analytical techniques per discipline
2. Develop search terms for each technique
3. Query Shark-References fulltext search, download CSVs
4. Analyze temporal trends (publications per technique per year)
5. Create visualizations for panel presentation

Questions for Discussion:
1. Database Infrastructure: What is Shark-References' current database format? Is there API access or potential for development?

2. Automated Queries: Would it be feasible to develop backend code that runs searches automatically (e.g., annually) to update trend analyses?

3. Dashboard Hosting: Might Shark-References be interested in hosting an "analytical methods trends dashboard" as an integrated feature? This could show:
   - Technique adoption over time
   - Regional/taxonomic breakdowns (if feasible)
   - Emerging vs. declining methods
   - Links to representative papers

4. Sustainability: How are Shark-References' staffing and funding currently managed? Understanding this would help us plan for long-term maintenance of any collaborative infrastructure.

5. Two-Way Data Enrichment: Our curated technique taxonomy could potentially feed back to SR as enhanced keyword tags, enabling more sophisticated user filtering.

We would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience. While we understand you won't be in Rotterdam, perhaps we could schedule a call in the coming weeks?

Thank you for considering this collaboration.

Best regards,
Simon Dedman
