## Timeline Flexibility Notes

**Current allocation:** 5.6 minutes per discipline (45 min ÷ 8 disciplines = 5.625 min)

**Future optimization:** Consider front-loading discipline overviews (3-4 min each) to reserve 10-15 minutes for end-of-session open forum discussion. May extend casually into lunch if audience engagement warrants.
