## Data Processing Pipeline

### Phase 1: Initial Amalgamation
**Script:** `scripts/amalgamate_techniques.R`

**Input:**
- `outputs/techniques_from_titles.csv` (99 rows)
- `outputs/techniques_from_abstracts_structured.csv` (53 rows)
- `Final Speakers EEA 2025.xlsx` (63 presentations)

**Process:**
1. Enriched abstract techniques with presenter metadata via filename matching
2. Created lookup table to link title techniques to presentation IDs
3. Combined both sources with deduplication strategy
4. Removed 5 duplicates where same presentation had same technique from both sources

**Initial Output:** 141 technique extractions

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning and ID Population
**Script:** `scripts/clean_amalgamated_techniques.R`

**Operations:**

#### 1. Technique Amalgamations (6 consolidations)
| Original Technique | Consolidated Into | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| IUCN Assessment | IUCN Red List Assessment | Same formal process |
| Extinction Risk Assessment | IUCN Red List Assessment | Core component |
| Reproduction (Fecundity) | Reproduction | Specific measurement aspect |
| Reproduction (Gestation) | Reproduction | Specific measurement aspect |
| Age & Growth (Vertebral Sectioning) | Age & Growth | Specific method |
| Random Forest | Machine Learning | Specific algorithm |

**Impact:** 6 technique variants consolidated, 5 duplicate rows removed

#### 2. Filename Corrections
**Issue:** 72 rows had incorrect placeholder filename "Poster EEA2025_abstract_Cemal Turan.docx"
**Action:** Set all to NA (accurate representation - no abstract file)
**Result:** 72 filenames corrected

#### 3. Presentation ID Population (Critical Fix)

**Initial Approach (INCORRECT):**
- Created sequential IDs using `row_number()` within format groups
- Assumed speaker table was in presentation order
- **Problem:** Table was alphabetically sorted by last name

**User Discovery:**
> "presentation_id O_06 is Steven Benjamins... the result is O_06... which is wrong - per Final Speakers EEA 2025.xlsx, data tab, it should be O_07"

**Root Cause:**
- Row 5: Steven Benjamins → Assigned O_05 (wrong, actual: O_06)
- Row 6: Atlantine Boggio-Pasqua → Assigned O_06 (wrong, actual: O_07)

**Corrected Approach:**
- Discovered `nr` column in Excel contains official presentation IDs
- Changed lookup logic from:
  ```r
  presentation_id_lookup = str_c(format_prefix, "_", sprintf("%02d", format_seq))
  ```
  to:
  ```r
  presentation_id_lookup = nr  # Use existing presentation ID
  ```

**Results:**
- ✅ Exact match: 71 presentation IDs populated
- ✅ Fuzzy match: 0 additional (remaining row was orphan)
- ✅ O_06 = Steven Benjamins (verified correct)
- ✅ O_07 = Atlantine Boggio-Pasqua (verified correct)

#### 4. Orphan Row Removal
**Issue:** 1 row from "Cemal Turan" file had NA for all identifying fields
**Action:** Removed unidentifiable row
**Result:** Dataset reduced from 136 to 135 rows

## Key Technical Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Unmatched Abstracts Lost (Initial Amalgamation)
**Problem:** Script filtered out abstracts where presenter name wasn't in filename
**Impact:** Lost ~36 technique extractions
**Fix:** Changed to keep ALL abstracts, using conditional logic to populate fields
**Code change:** Removed `filter(name_in_file)`, used `if_else()` for conditional population

### Issue 2: Sequential ID Assignment Error (Critical)
**Problem:** Created IDs using `row_number()` on alphabetically sorted table
**Impact:** Misassigned IDs (e.g., O_06 assigned to row 6 instead of Steven Benjamins)
**Discovery:** User identified specific mismatch with O_06/O_07
**Root cause:** Assumed table order matched presentation order
**Fix:** Used existing `nr` column from Excel with official IDs
**Verification:** Confirmed correct assignments for all presentations

### Issue 3: Orphan Row from Malformed File
**Problem:** 1 row had NA for all identifying fields (presentation_id, title, presenter)
**Source:** "Cemal Turan" file with corrupt/missing metadata
**Fix:** Filtered out rows where all identifying fields are NA
**Impact:** Final dataset reduced by 1 row (135 instead of 136)

## Reproducibility

### Prerequisites
- R (version 4.x or higher)
- tidyverse package (≥ 2.0.0)
- readxl package

### Execution Steps

1. **Run amalgamation:**
   ```bash
   cd "/path/to/Data Panel"
   Rscript scripts/amalgamate_techniques.R
   ```
   Output: `outputs/techniques_from_titles_abstracts.csv` (141 rows)

2. **Run cleaning:**
   ```bash
   Rscript scripts/clean_amalgamated_techniques.R
   ```
   Output: Overwrites to `outputs/techniques_from_titles_abstracts.csv` (135 rows)

**⚠️ Important:** Cleaning script overwrites input file. To preserve intermediate output:
```bash
cp outputs/techniques_from_titles_abstracts.csv outputs/techniques_before_cleaning.csv
```

## Recommendations for Analysis

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Generate visualizations**
   - Technique frequency by discipline (bar charts)
   - Discipline distribution (pie/donut chart)
   - Technique co-occurrence networks

2. **Create co-occurrence matrix**
   - Identify which techniques appear together
   - Map interdisciplinary research patterns

3. **Presenter profiling**
   - Characterize presenters by technique combinations
   - Identify methodological specialists vs. generalists

### Advanced Analysis Opportunities
1. **Compare with literature trends**
   - Analyze technique usage in published papers (2020-2025)
   - Identify emerging vs. declining methods
   - Spot gaps in conference representation

2. **Temporal analysis** (if historical data available)
   - Track technique adoption over conference years
   - Identify innovation patterns
   - Forecast future methodological directions

3. **Network analysis**
   - Build technique-discipline networks
   - Identify bridging techniques (used across disciplines)
   - Map methodological clustering

4. **Validation study**
   - Manual review of 15-20 randomly sampled presentations
   - Verify automated technique classification accuracy
   - Refine pattern library based on findings

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Abstract coverage:** Only 70 of 135 rows (51.9%) have associated abstract files
   - Some presentations may not have submitted abstracts
   - Some abstracts may have been lost/not processed

2. **Technique granularity:** Consolidated to appropriate level, but some detail lost
   - Example: "Reproduction (Fecundity)" → "Reproduction"
   - Trade-off between specificity and manageability

3. **Single presenter per presentation:** Data structure assumes one primary presenter
   - May not capture all authors/contributors

4. **Pattern matching limitations:** Automated extraction may miss context-dependent mentions
   - Some techniques may be mentioned but not actually used
   - Some used techniques may not be explicitly named

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Confidence scoring:** Add field indicating extraction confidence
   - High: Pattern match in methods section
   - Medium: Pattern match in abstract body
   - Low: Pattern match in title only

2. **Multiple techniques per mention:** Some presentations use technique combinations
   - Example: "machine learning for species distribution modeling"
   - Could be tagged with both techniques

3. **Hierarchical technique taxonomy:** Create parent-child relationships
   - Example: Machine Learning > Random Forest > Gradient Boosting
   - Allows analysis at multiple levels of granularity

4. **Manual validation flags:** Add field for expert review status
   - Allows systematic quality control
   - Identifies ambiguous cases for discussion

5. **Integration with full conference program:** Cross-reference with session information
   - Add session themes
   - Identify technique clustering by session
   - Link to symposium organizers
