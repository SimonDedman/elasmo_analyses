**Insights:**
- Genetics dominates shark science (85% of papers)
- Data science is pervasive (48%), mostly cross-cutting
- Behavior is underrepresented (2.8%)

### Data Science Segmentation

| Category | Papers | % of DATA |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Cross-cutting DATA | 3,204 | 70.5% |
| Primary DATA + others | 1,237 | 27.2% |
| DATA only | 104 | 2.3% |

**Key Insight:** Data science is overwhelmingly integrated into other disciplines rather than standalone.

### Top 10 Techniques

| Rank | Technique | Papers | Discipline |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | STRUCTURE | 7,535 | GEN |
| 2 | Connectivity | 1,068 | GEN |
| 3 | Stock Assessment | 984 | FISH |
| 4 | Parasitology | 927 | BIO |
| 5 | Tourism | 777 | CON |
| 6 | Time Series | 691 | DATA |
| 7 | Phylogenetics | 614 | GEN |
| 8 | Morphometrics | 572 | BIO |
| 9 | Metabolic Rate | 555 | BIO |
| 10 | Genomics | 513 | GEN |

**Note:** STRUCTURE appears in 80% of papers - requires validation for false positives.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Distribute to colleagues** for peer review:
   - Send `docs/database/extraction_progress_report.md`
   - Request validation of top techniques (esp. STRUCTURE)
   - Get feedback on cross-cutting DATA definition
   - Identify any missing techniques or biases

2. **Manual validation** (sample checks):
   - 100 STRUCTURE mentions → calculate false positive rate
   - 50 random papers → verify technique accuracy
   - 20 pre-1990 papers → check OCR quality
   - 30 "no techniques" papers → identify reasons

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

3. **Fix researcher database schema**:
   - Correct column names in `paper_authors` table
   - Fix `researcher_techniques` schema
   - Re-run full extraction for complete researcher data

4. **Create visualizations**:
   - Discipline trends over time (line charts)
   - Technique adoption timelines
   - DATA cross-cutting tree graphic
   - Discipline co-occurrence network

### Medium-Term (Before EEA 2025)

5. **Researcher network analysis**:
   - Collaboration networks
   - Technique usage by researcher
   - Institutional affiliations
   - Geographic distribution

6. **Species linkage** (if time permits):
   - Validate species detection
   - Link techniques → species
   - Method-specific applications analysis

### EEA 2025 Conference (30 October 2025)

7. **Panel presentation**:
   - Present extraction findings
   - Show discipline trends
   - Demonstrate DATA cross-cutting
   - Collect community feedback

8. **Post-conference refinement**:
   - Incorporate feedback
   - Add missing techniques identified
   - Update documentation

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Researcher Network (⚠️ Incomplete)

**Issue:** Database schema mismatch prevented full population
- Only 62 researchers extracted (should be ~10,000+)
- No collaboration network
- No researcher-technique links

**Cause:** Column name errors in database schema

**Fix:** ~1 hour to correct schema and re-run extraction

**Impact:** Does not affect technique/discipline analysis (already complete)

### Potential Biases (⚠️ Requires Review)

1. **STRUCTURE over-representation** - May include false positives
2. **Technique selection bias** - 182 techniques chosen by database authors
3. **Language bias** - English-language papers only
4. **Temporal bias** - Pre-2000 papers may have poorer OCR
5. **Cross-cutting DATA definition** - 128 techniques may be too broad

**Recommendation:** Manual validation via peer review process

### Missing Elements (Future Work)

- Shark species linkage (detected but not analyzed)
- Geographic analysis (countries detected but not validated)
- Funding sources (not extracted)
- Journal impact factors (not extracted)
- ORCID integration (not extracted)
