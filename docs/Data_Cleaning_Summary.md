# Data Cleaning Summary

## Overview

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Script:** `scripts/clean_amalgamated_techniques.R`
**Input:** `outputs/techniques_from_titles_abstracts.csv` (141 rows)
**Output:** `outputs/techniques_from_titles_abstracts.csv` (135 rows)

## Changes Applied

### 1. Technique Amalgamations

Combined related technique variants to reduce redundancy and improve consistency:

| Original Technique | New Technique | Count | Reason |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| IUCN Assessment | IUCN Red List Assessment | 10 → 16 | Same concept |
| Reproduction (Fecundity) | Reproduction | 3 → 7 | Specific aspect of reproduction |
| Reproduction (Gestation) | Reproduction | 1 → 7 | Specific aspect of reproduction |
| Age & Growth (Vertebral Sectioning) | Age & Growth | 1 → 8 | Specific method within age/growth |
| Random Forest | Machine Learning | 3 → 10 | RF is a ML algorithm |
| Extinction Risk Assessment | IUCN Red List Assessment | 1 → 16 | Core component of IUCN RL |

**Total amalgamations:** 6 technique mappings
**Duplicates removed:** 5 rows (same presentation now has amalgamated technique)

### 2. Filename Corrections

**Issue:** 72 rows had filename = "Poster EEA2025_abstract_Cemal Turan.docx"
- This was an incorrect placeholder filename from the title extraction process
- These were title-based extractions that didn't have associated abstract files

**Action:** Set all "Cemal Turan" filenames to NA

**Result:**
- 72 filenames changed to NA
- Maintains consistency (NA filename = no abstract file)

### 3. Presentation ID Population

**Issue:** 72 rows lacked `presentation_id` after filename correction

**Action:** Matched presentations via exact lookup:
- Matched on: `(title, presenter_first, presenter_last)` → `presentation_id`
- Used speaker table with sequential IDs based on format (O_XX for oral, P_XX for poster)

**Results:**
- **Exact matches:** 71 presentation IDs successfully populated
- **Fuzzy matches attempted:** 0 additional matches (remaining 1 row had no identifiable information)
- **Orphan row removed:** 1 row with all NAs (from malformed abstract file)

**Final presentation ID coverage:**
- With presentation_id: 135 rows (100%)
- Unique presentations: 61

### 4. Orphan Row Removal

**Issue:** 1 row remained with:
- `presentation_id = NA`
- `title = NA`
- `presenter_first = NA`
- `presenter_last = NA`
- Only had: `technique = "Machine Learning"`, `pattern = "random.*forest"`

**Source:** "Poster EEA2025_abstract_Cemal Turan.docx" with NA presentation_id in original abstracts file

**Action:** Removed this unidentifiable orphan row

## Data Quality Improvements

### Before Cleaning
- ✗ Duplicate technique names (e.g., "IUCN Assessment" vs "IUCN Red List Assessment")
- ✗ Overly specific technique variants (e.g., "Reproduction (Fecundity)")
- ✗ Incorrect placeholder filenames ("Cemal Turan")
- ✗ 72 rows without presentation_id (52% missing)
- ✗ 1 orphan row with no identifiable information

### After Cleaning
- ✓ Consistent technique naming
- ✓ Appropriate level of technique granularity
- ✓ Accurate filename values (NA when no abstract)
- ✓ 100% presentation_id coverage
- ✓ All rows identifiable and linkable to presentations

## Technique Consolidation Details

### IUCN Red List Assessment (10 → 16)
**Consolidated from:**
- IUCN Assessment (10 instances)
- Extinction Risk Assessment (1 instance)
- IUCN Red List Assessment (7 existing)

**Rationale:** All three terms refer to the same IUCN Red List assessment process. "IUCN Assessment" and "Extinction Risk Assessment" are informal names for the formal "IUCN Red List Assessment."

### Reproduction (5 → 7)
**Consolidated from:**
- Reproduction (5 existing)
- Reproduction (Fecundity) (3 instances)
- Reproduction (Gestation) (1 instance)

**Rationale:** Fecundity and gestation are specific aspects of reproduction. While these are distinct measurements, they both fall under the broader category of reproductive biology for technique classification purposes.

### Age & Growth (7 → 7, but 1 absorbed)
**Consolidated from:**
- Age & Growth (7 existing)
- Age & Growth (Vertebral Sectioning) (1 instance)

**Rationale:** Vertebral sectioning is one specific method for age determination. The technique category should be "Age & Growth" with methods specified elsewhere if needed.

### Machine Learning (7 → 9)
**Consolidated from:**
- Machine Learning (7 existing)
- Random Forest (3 instances)

**Rationale:** Random Forest is a specific machine learning algorithm. For technique classification at this level, it's appropriate to use the broader "Machine Learning" category rather than individual algorithms.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

### 1. Technique Co-occurrence
- Analyze which techniques frequently appear together in the same presentation
- Identify interdisciplinary research patterns

### 2. Presenter Profiles
- Characterize presenters by their technique combinations
- Identify methodological specialists vs. generalists

### 3. Missing Data Investigation
- **Some abstracts still have NA for title/presenter:**
  - These are legitimate cases where abstract files don't contain this metadata
  - Could be manually filled from conference program if needed

### 4. Validation
- Review the 71 automatically populated presentation_ids
- Spot-check a sample (e.g., 10-15 presentations) to confirm accuracy

### 5. Further Amalgamations (Optional)
Consider if additional consolidations would be useful:

**Diet/Trophic Techniques:**
- DNA Metabarcoding (Trophic) - 3
- Stomach Content Analysis (Trophic) - 3
- Diet Analysis (Trophic) - 3
- Stable Isotope Analysis (Trophic) - 4

*Recommendation:* Keep separate - these represent distinct methodological approaches

**Genetic Techniques:**
- Genomics (3), Population Genetics (2), Microsatellites (1), Phylogenetics (1), eDNA (2), Whole Genome Sequencing (1)

*Recommendation:* Consider grouping some genomics techniques, but current granularity is appropriate for tracking method adoption

**Movement Techniques:**
- Acoustic Telemetry (11), Movement Modeling (3), Connectivity (2), Habitat Modeling (3), Species Distribution Model (1)

*Recommendation:* Keep separate - these represent distinct analytical approaches within movement ecology

## Next Steps

1. ✓ **Data cleaning complete** - Ready for analysis
2. **Generate visualizations** - Create discipline/technique plots
3. **Create technique co-occurrence matrix** - Identify interdisciplinary patterns
4. **Presenter analysis** - Profile presenters by techniques
5. **Literature comparison** - Compare against technique usage in published literature
