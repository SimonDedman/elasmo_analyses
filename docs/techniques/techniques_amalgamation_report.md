# Techniques Amalgamation Report

## Overview

This report documents the amalgamation of analytical techniques extracted from presentation titles and abstracts for the EEA 2025 Data Panel analysis.

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Output File:** `outputs/techniques_from_titles_abstracts.csv`
**Script:** `scripts/amalgamate_techniques.R`

---

## Objective

Combine techniques extracted from two sources:
1. **Presentation titles** (`outputs/techniques_from_titles.csv`)
2. **Abstract content** (`outputs/techniques_from_abstracts_structured.csv`)

**Deduplication Strategy:** Remove entries where the same presentation has the same technique identified from both title AND abstract, while preserving all unique technique extractions (including multiple different techniques from the same presentation).

---

## Input Data

### Source 1: Techniques from Titles
- **File:** `outputs/techniques_from_titles.csv`
- **Rows:** 99 technique extractions (100 lines including header)
- **Fields:** format, title, presenter_first, presenter_last, technique, discipline
- **Method:** Pattern matching on presentation titles using predefined regex patterns
- **Script:** `scripts/extract_techniques_from_titles.R`
- **Note:** No `presentation_id` or `pattern` fields; no `filename` field

### Source 2: Techniques from Abstracts
- **File:** `outputs/techniques_from_abstracts_structured.csv`
- **Rows:** 53 technique extractions (54 lines including header)
- **Fields:** filename, pattern, context, technique, discipline, presentation_id
- **Method:** Pattern matching on abstract text using regex patterns
- **Script:** `scripts/parse_techniques_from_abstracts.R`
- **Note:** `presentation_id` embedded in filename (e.g., "O_03", "P_14"); no title or presenter fields

### Presentation Metadata
- **File:** `Final Speakers EEA 2025.xlsx`
- **Rows:** 63 presentations
- **Key Fields:** Title, Name (First), Name (Last), format

---

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Loading
Loaded all three data sources:
- 63 presentations from Excel spreadsheet
- 99 techniques from titles (93 unique after combining with abstracts)
- 53 techniques from abstracts

### Step 2: Abstract Enrichment with Presenter Metadata
**Challenge:** Abstract-based extractions had `presentation_id` and `filename` but lacked presenter names and titles.

**Solution:**
1. Performed cross-join between abstracts and speakers tables
2. Matched based on presenter last name appearing in abstract filename
3. For successful matches: populated title, presenter_first, presenter_last
4. For failed matches: kept abstract technique with NA values for title/presenter fields
5. **Key improvement from initial version:** Kept ALL abstract techniques, not just matched ones

**Result:**
- Processed 39 unique presentation IDs from abstracts
- 17 abstracts matched to speaker metadata (have title/presenter info)
- 36 abstracts without speaker match (kept with NA for title/presenter)

### Step 3: Title Techniques Linked to Presentation IDs
**Challenge:** Title-based extractions had presenter names and titles but lacked `presentation_id`.

**Solution:**
1. Used successfully matched abstracts to create lookup table: `(presenter_first, presenter_last, title) â†’ presentation_id`
2. Joined title techniques to this lookup
3. For successful matches: added `presentation_id` and `filename`
4. For failed matches: kept technique with NA for `presentation_id` and `filename`

**Result:**
- Matched 22 of 93 title techniques to presentation IDs
- Remaining 71 title techniques kept with NA for `presentation_id`

### Step 4: Data Combination
Combined both sources using `bind_rows()` with titles first to give preference during deduplication:
- 93 title-based techniques
- 53 abstract-based techniques
- **Combined total:** 146 technique extractions

### Step 5: Deduplication
**Approach:** Remove duplicate technique extractions ONLY where:
1. Both extractions have a valid `presentation_id` (can confirm same presentation)
2. AND both extractions have the same `technique` and `discipline`

**Process:**
1. Separated combined data into:
   - **Matched:** 41 techniques with valid `presentation_id` (can check for duplicates)
   - **Unmatched:** 71 techniques without `presentation_id` (kept all)
2. For matched techniques:
   - Normalized technique and discipline names (trim whitespace)
   - Grouped by `(presentation_id, technique, discipline)`
   - Kept first occurrence per group (preference for title source which came first)
3. Recombined deduplicated matched + all unmatched

**Result:**
- Removed 5 duplicates from matched presentations
- Final dataset: **141 unique technique extractions**
  - 39 from presentations with matched IDs (after deduplication)
  - 71 from unmatched title-only presentations
  - 31 from abstract-only presentations (no title match)

### Step 6: Output Preparation
Created final CSV with required fields:
- `presentation_id`: Unique identifier (e.g., "O_03", "P_12") or NA
- `filename`: Abstract filename or NA (for title-only)
- `title`: Presentation title or NA (for unmatched abstracts)
- `presenter_first`: First name or NA
- `presenter_last`: Last name or NA
- `pattern`: Regex pattern used (NA for title-based extractions)
- `technique`: Technique name (e.g., "Acoustic Telemetry")
- `discipline`: Discipline category (e.g., "Movement", "Biology")

## Data Quality Notes

### Coverage
1. **141 technique extractions from 152 total** (99 title + 53 abstract)
   - 5 duplicates removed (3.3% overlap)
   - Good coverage with minimal redundancy

2. **Presentations with presentation_id: 39**
   - These are presentations with submitted abstracts
   - Remaining presentations only have title-based extractions

3. **Presentations without presentation_id: Unknown number**
   - These have techniques extracted from titles only
   - Could not be linked to abstracts (no abstract submitted or matching failed)

### Matching Accuracy
- **Abstract-to-speaker matching:** 17 of 53 abstract techniques (32%) successfully matched to speaker metadata
- **Title-to-presentation_id matching:** 22 of 93 title techniques (24%) successfully matched to presentation IDs
- **Overall:** Low matching rate due to:
  - Abstract filenames not always containing presenter last names
  - Presentations without submitted abstracts
  - Name variations and special characters in filenames

### Data Completeness
- **Complete records (all fields populated):** Rows where presentation was successfully matched to both title and abstract
- **Partial records (some NA values):** Majority of records
  - Title-only: Have title/presenter but no `presentation_id`/`filename`
  - Abstract-only unmatched: Have `presentation_id`/`filename` but no title/presenter
  - Abstract-only matched: Have all fields

### Recommendations
1. **For improved coverage:** Implement more robust presentation identifier system
2. **For better matching:** Clean filename conventions or use submission IDs
3. **For validation:** Manually review high-impact presentations
4. **For completeness:** Cross-reference with conference program to fill in missing presenter/title information
