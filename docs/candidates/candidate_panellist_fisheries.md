**Date:** 17 October 2025
**Purpose:** Assessment of three Senior Researcher candidates for the fisheries discipline panel role

---

## Dr. Manuel Dureuil

**Current Position:** President & Co-founder, Shark and Ray Conservation Centre (SHARCC); Dalhousie University affiliation
**Location:** Canada (North America)
**Career Stage:** PhD 2019 (Dalhousie University), ~6 years post-PhD
**Citations:** 1,049 citations (Google Scholar)

**Research Profile:**
Dr. Dureuil is an award-winning shark and ray biologist who has been researching elasmobranchs since 2009. His research spans theoretical modeling of population trajectories and spatial distributions to field-based tagging experiments. His expertise encompasses life history, spatial ecology, historical ecology, restoration ecology, and conservation biology, with a strong focus on fisheries impacts.

**Key Publications & Impact:**
- High-impact Science publication (2018): "Elevated trawling inside protected areas undermines conservation outcomes in a global fishing hot spot" (Science 362:1403-1407) - demonstrating 69% decline in shark, skate and ray populations in heavily trawled MPAs
- ICES Journal of Marine Science (2019): Novel approach for stock status assessment from length-frequency data
- Frontiers in Marine Science (2023): First multi-species shark nursery area in Atlantic Africa
- Fisheries Research (2022): Growth estimation methods in elasmobranchs from mark-recapture data
- Multiple IUCN Red List assessments for shark species

**Affinity to Fisheries Techniques:**
Strong alignment with fisheries assessment and monitoring techniques. His work directly addresses stock assessment methodologies (particularly for data-poor species), spatial ecology relevant to fisheries management, mark-recapture tagging programs, population modeling, and fisheries impact assessment. His MPA/trawling research demonstrates expertise in evaluating fishing gear impacts. His focus on conservation biology and ecosystem-based management aligns with modern fisheries science approaches.

**Strengths:**
Extensive experience (15+ years in field), high-impact publications, leadership role in conservation organization, international field experience (Canada, Europe, West Africa), strong track record in translating research to management applications. Previous EEA participation (2013). Demonstrated expertise in both theoretical and applied fisheries science.

## Dr. Mišo Pavičić

**Current Position:** Researcher, Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Split
**Location:** Croatia (Europe)
**Career Stage:** Senior researcher (exact PhD year unclear from searches)
**Citations:** Not individually quantified (publications well-cited)

**Research Profile:**
Dr. Pavičić is a fisheries scientist specializing in crustacean biology and fisheries management in the Mediterranean, particularly the Adriatic Sea. His research focuses on commercially important species, with particular expertise in European lobster populations. His work combines population genetics, fisheries biology, and sustainable management approaches for regional marine resources.

**Key Publications & Impact:**
- Frontiers in Genetics (2020): "Population Genetic Structure and Connectivity of the European Lobster Homarus gammarus in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas" - comprehensive genetic analysis using 14 microsatellite loci and COI sequencing
- Water (2021): "Population Characteristics of the European Lobster, Homarus gammarus in the Adriatic Sea: Implications for Sustainable Fisheries Management" - multi-year sampling (2016-2017) with landings analysis (2008-2020)
- Frontiers in Marine Science (2022): Climate impacts on lobster CPUE (sea bottom temperature effects)
- BioInvasions Records (2020): First record of American lobster in Mediterranean
- Multiple species documentation papers contributing to regional biodiversity knowledge

**Affinity to Fisheries Techniques:**
Good alignment with practical fisheries techniques, particularly stock assessment, population monitoring, and sustainable fisheries management. Expertise in commercial crustacean fisheries using pots and gillnets. Strong background in population genetics applied to fisheries connectivity. Work addresses CPUE analysis, catch data interpretation, and climate effects on fisheries. Focus on data collection and analysis for management recommendations in regional European fisheries context.

**Strengths:**
Regional expertise in European/Mediterranean fisheries, practical fisheries management focus, strong publication record in fisheries journals, institutional stability at established marine research institute. Work directly applicable to European fisheries policy. Systematic long-term research program on commercially important species.

## Dr. Rachel Winter

**Current Position:** Postdoctoral Researcher, Paul Sabatier University - Toulouse III (ECOLAB); Arctic ecogeochemistry focus
**Location:** France (Europe), previous affiliation with University of Copenhagen and University of Groningen
**Career Stage:** PhD 2023 (University of Groningen), ~2 years post-PhD
**Citations:** 49 citations (Google Scholar)

**Research Profile:**
Dr. Winter is a biomolecular archaeologist and historical ecologist who applies cutting-edge biomolecular techniques to fisheries questions. Her PhD focused on Mediterranean grouper exploitation over 4,000 years, combining traditional zooarchaeology with innovative proteomics (ZooMS) to establish historical baselines for fisheries management. Her work provides crucial long-term ecological context for understanding anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems.

**Key Publications & Impact:**
- Ecology and Evolution (2023): "Grouping groupers in the Mediterranean: Ecological baselines revealed by ancient proteins" - doctoral research revealing 22 novel species-specific ZooMS biomarkers, demonstrating white grouper historically reached 150 cm (30 cm larger than modern records), establishing 4,000-year baseline for Epinephelus aeneus resilience
- Research interests include ichthyoarchaeology, paleoproteomics, historical ecology, stable isotope analysis, and marine shagreen

**Affinity to Fisheries Techniques:**
Limited direct alignment with contemporary fisheries techniques. Her expertise lies in historical ecology and biomolecular archaeology rather than active fisheries science. While her work provides valuable baseline data for fisheries management and understanding long-term exploitation patterns, it does not encompass stock assessment, fishing gear evaluation, population modeling, or other standard fisheries techniques. Her methodological expertise (ZooMS, ancient DNA, stable isotopes) is complementary to but distinct from operational fisheries science.

**Strengths:**
Innovative methodological approach, provides historical context crucial for shifting baselines understanding, interdisciplinary perspective bridging archaeology and ecology. Young career with high potential. Focus on overfished Mediterranean species (groupers) of high conservation concern.

**Limitations for Panel Role:**
Early career stage (2 years post-PhD vs. 6+ years for Dureuil), limited direct experience with contemporary fisheries operations or techniques, smaller publication portfolio, research focus on historical rather than current fisheries, methodological specialization does not align closely with standard fisheries assessment techniques database.

## Recommendation Summary

**For the fisheries discipline panellist role, ranked by suitability:**

1. **Dr. Manuel Dureuil** - Strongest candidate overall. Extensive experience (15 years), high-impact publication record, leadership in conservation organization, direct expertise in fisheries assessment and management techniques, international scope, previous EEA experience. Optimal balance of age/experience and active research profile.

2. **Dr. Mišo Pavičić** - Strong candidate with practical fisheries focus. Regional expertise in European fisheries management, sustained publication record on commercially important species, institutional stability, direct application to European policy context. Solid choice for practical fisheries knowledge.

3. **Dr. Rachel Winter** - Least suitable for this specific panel role. While her research is innovative and valuable, she is early career with limited direct fisheries techniques experience. Her historical ecology approach, while providing important context, does not align well with the operational fisheries techniques focus expected for the panel.

**Final Recommendation:** **Dr. Manuel Dureuil** is the optimal choice, combining substantial experience, high research impact, broad technical expertise in fisheries methods, and proven ability to translate research to management applications.
