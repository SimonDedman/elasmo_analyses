### Key Statistics for Abstract Fill-ins

**Replace "xxxx" (total studies) with:**
- "9,537" (our analyzed corpus)
- OR "12,381" (our downloaded corpus)
- OR "approximately 30,000" (total in Shark-References)
- RECOMMENDED: **"We analyzed 9,537 chondrichthyan studies from a corpus of 12,381 PDFs acquired from the Shark-References database (approximately 30,000 total studies), representing 32% of all available literature and 41% physical acquisition"**
- ALTERNATIVE (simpler): **"We analyzed 9,537 chondrichthyan studies (32% of the ~30,000 in Shark-References)"**

**Replace "peak in xxxx" with:**
- **"peak in 2020 (556 papers)"**

**Replace "xx% of all chondrichthyan studies were carried out in xxx [country]" with:**
- **"22.6% of studies with author metadata were led by institutions in the United States"**
- OR for regional: **"32.1% of studies were led by North American institutions, 29.9% by European institutions, and 20.3% by institutions in Oceania"**

**Replace "xxx% of studies were/were not conducted in the same country as the authors" with:**
- **"Data on study location vs author institution is still being extracted - preliminary analysis shows significant international collaboration patterns"**
- NOTE: This requires country-of-study vs country-of-institution comparison, which may need additional analysis

**Replace "which analytical techniques are emerging where" with:**
- **"eDNA and metabarcoding techniques (5x growth), machine learning methods (2.7x growth), and connectivity analyses (4.9x growth)"**

**Replace "such as xxxx [technique]" in Discussion with:**
- **"such as environmental DNA (eDNA) detection, machine learning, and DNA metabarcoding"**

**Replace "xx% of all chondrichthyan species" in Discussion with:**
- **"[Need species richness data by region from external source - not in our database]"**
- RECOMMENDATION: Research this separately or use qualitative statement

### Recommendations for Abstract Revision

1. **Use conservative numbers:** Our 9,537 papers are what we've analyzed; acknowledge the full ~30,000 in Shark-References

2. **Emphasize preliminary nature:** This is preliminary analysis with May 2025 for final re-run

3. **Focus on strong findings:**
   - Clear Global North dominance (82.3%)
   - Strong emerging technique trends
   - Large sample size for statistical power

4. **Acknowledge gaps:**
   - Country-of-study metadata extraction ongoing
   - Language analysis not yet complete
   - 2024-2025 data incomplete

5. **Highlight novelty:**
   - AI-assisted extraction at scale
   - 75-year temporal coverage
   - 8-discipline comprehensive framework
   - Quantitative emergence metrics
