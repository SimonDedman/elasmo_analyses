5.  **Movement & Space Use** *(Partially covered by Spatial)*
    -   Currently split between "Spatial" (SDM) and implied elsewhere
    -   Movement ecology dominates conferences (AES dedicated session)
    -   Distinct from habitat modeling: telemetry, satellite tracking,
        movement models
6.  **Citizen Science & Social Science** *(Missing but in Carrier)*
    -   Dedicated section in Carrier et al. (2019)
    -   You noted as "cross-cutting approach" but has unique methods
    -   Social dimensions, human-shark conflict (Cat Gordon expertise
        available)
7.  **Data Integration & Analytical Methods** *(Emerging)*
    -   Entire AES 2024 HL Symposium on this topic
    -   Distinct from pure statistics: combining heterogeneous datasets
    -   Bayesian integration, occupancy models, genomic SDMs
8.  **Aquarium Science & Ex-Situ Research** *(Specialized)*
    -   AES 2024 symposium dedicated to aquarium contributions
    -   Unique methods: controlled studies, breeding, public engagement
    -   Mark Packer identified as potential expert
9.  **Trophic Ecology** *(Within Ecology but could separate)*

## Climate Change Integration Strategy

### Approach

Climate change is **NOT a standalone discipline** but a **cross-cutting
analytical theme** that must be explicitly addressed within multiple
disciplines.

### Implementation per Discipline

**Biology & Life History:** - Temperature effects on growth rates,
reproduction timing - Thermal tolerance, metabolic impacts -
Distributional shifts affecting life history strategies - Methods:
Climate-mediated demographic models, thermal performance curves

**Behaviour & Sensory Ecology:** - Behavioral plasticity to
temperature/oxygen changes - Climate-driven shifts in activity patterns,
habitat use - Methods: Experimental approaches, long-term behavioral
datasets

**Trophic & Community Ecology:** - Climate impacts on prey availability,
trophic interactions - Ecosystem reorganization, trophic cascades -
Methods: Time-series analysis, food web models with climate forcing

**Genetics, Genomics, & eDNA:** - Adaptive potential to climate change -
Genomic vulnerability, genomic offset - Methods: Redundancy analysis,
genomic SDMs, landscape genomics

**Movement & Spatial:** - Range shifts, poleward expansion - Climate
refugia identification - Methods: SDM climate projections, climate
velocity analysis, future habitat suitability

**Fisheries & Stock Assessment:** - Climate impacts on stock
productivity, recruitment - Shifting fishery opportunities and
conflicts - Methods: Climate-linked stock assessment, regime shift
detection

**Conservation Policy:** - Climate adaptation strategies - Climate-smart
MPA design - Methods: Climate vulnerability assessments, adaptive
management frameworks

**Data Science:** - Climate change modeling techniques (GCMs,
downscaling) - Uncertainty propagation in climate projections - Methods:
Ensemble modeling, scenario analysis, climate analog approaches

### Panel Implementation

-   Each discipline lead identifies 2-3 key climate-relevant methods
-   Highlight in mind maps with distinct visual marker (e.g.,
    thermometer icon)
-   Open forum question: "How is your discipline addressing climate
    change?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recommendations

### For Panel Planning

**RECOMMEND: Option B (8 Disciplines - Consolidated Strategic)**

**Rationale:** 1. **Manageable scope:** 8 disciplines fit 50-minute
format (6 min review each = 48 min, leaves 2 min flex) 2. **Reflects
conference trends:** Mirrors EEA/AES session structure 3. **Expert
availability:** Can identify leads/assistants for all 8 areas 4.
**Analytical coherence:** Groups methods logically without excessive
fragmentation 5. **Covers gaps:** Explicitly includes behaviour, health,
citizen science, data integration 6. **Climate integration:** Framework
allows cross-cutting climate theme

**Proposed Session Structure (8 disciplines × 6 min = 48 min + 2 min
intro):** 1. Biology, Life History, & Health (6 min) 2. Behaviour &
Sensory Ecology (6 min) 3. Trophic & Community Ecology (6 min) 4.
Genetics, Genomics, & eDNA (6 min) 5. Movement, Space Use, & Habitat
Modeling (6 min) 6. Fisheries, Stock Assessment, & Management (6 min) 7.
Conservation Policy & Human Dimensions (6 min) 8. Data Science &
Integrative Methods (6 min)

**Alternative:** Combine with speaker presentations (10 min talk + 6 min
review = 16 min per discipline, need to select 3-4 disciplines only).
Would lose comprehensiveness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Recruitment Priorities

**High Priority (Must Fill):** 1. Movement & Spatial - Edward Lavender
confirmed ✓ 2. Genetics & Genomics - Anouk Langerak confirmed ✓ 3. Data
Science - Maria Dolores confirmed ✓ 4. Conservation Policy - Nicholas
Dulvy confirmed ✓

**Medium Priority (Likely Available):** 5. Biology & Health - David
Jiménez Alvarado, Chris Mull 6. Fisheries - Manuel Dureuil, Sebastian
Uhlmann

**Recruitment Needed:** 7. Behaviour & Sensory - Check AES 2024
attendees (Caroline Sullivan, Andrew Nosal, Marianne Porter candidates)
8. Trophic Ecology - Emily Meese (postdoc \@ UCSB), check isotope
experts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Next Steps

1.  **Immediate (Week 1):**
    -   Decide on Option B (8 disciplines) vs. Option C (6 disciplines)
    -   If Option B: Identify Behaviour and Trophic Ecology leads
    -   Update spreadsheet template with chosen discipline structure
2.  **Expert Briefing (Week 2):**
    -   Provide discipline-specific inclusion/exclusion guidance
    -   Share climate change integration framework
    -   Emphasize analytical methods focus (not just topic areas)
3.  **Methodology Refinement:**
    -   Add discipline boundary definitions to expert briefing materials
    -   Create decision tree for edge cases
    -   Include examples of included/excluded topics per discipline
